- `add-mod.nu` - half assed attempt at cleanly extracting mods with the right format and name for S3MO to use
- `cpfolder.bat` - master copy of script in `Mods`
- `enfolder.bat` - master copy of script in `Mods`
- `extractor.bat` - master copy of script in `Mods`
- `s3mo-cleanup.ps1`
	- Identify mods that are found in the S3MO `Mods` folder but are not enabled in any of the existing profiles.
	- Optional flag `-MoveToTrash` outputs command lines for each mod to use the `recycle-bin` command to move the unused mod folder to the system recycle bin.
	- A required `-IgnoreFile` parameter provides a path to a file containing one regex per line that tells the script to ignore disabled mods matching the pattern
	- required `-S3moDir` parameter gives the path to the S3MO directory, which contains the `Profiles` and `Mods` directories
	- e.g.: `powershell -File .\s3mo-cleanup.ps1 -S3moDir "C:\Users\kel\Documents\Electronic Arts\2 Common S3MO" -IgnoreFile .\ignore.txt`
- `Rename-ArchiveTimestamp.ps1`
	- renames an archive that contains a mod, appending a timestamp onto the name of the archive file
	- the timestamp is based on the youngest file in the archive
	- the timestamp format is `YYYYmmdd-HHMMSS`
	- E.g., running the script on an archive file named `Bob-Mod.7z` will look at all the archive members of the file, and get the timestamps for each archive member. If the most recently updated file in the archive has a timestamp of `January 2, 2024 @ 1:45:23PM`, then the archive will be renamed to `Bob-Mod_20240102-134523.7z`
- `Rename-Archive` (`Rename-Archive.lnk`)
	- A windows shell shortcut that will correctly run `Rename-ArchiveTimestatmp.ps1` from the shell
	- An archive file can be dropped onto the shortcut and the archive file will be renamed
	- The shortcut can (and should) be copied anywhere it would be convenient to use
	- The shortcut does not need to be located where the archive is
	- The archive will remain in its original parent directory after being renamed
